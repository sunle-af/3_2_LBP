### Description 
In recent years, there has been continuous development in machine learning technology
and this has also lead to a new standard in Target recognition with respect to Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) images. SAR is a field that has a lot of promise and is currently
attracting a lot of research interest. Researchers are particularly interested in using machine learning to analyse and interact with SAR videos. We analysed SAR photographs of Roorkee obtained from two separate sources: Sentinel-1 and ALOS PALSAR. Railway line tracks and
urban structures surrounded by foliage were identified as targets. In this method, we used a
variety of machine learning techniques.This project has limitless applications, for example,
on the oceans, where ships can be identified and tracked by their wakes. In addition, regular
leakage from oil storage facilities is commonly observed. This could reveal more about the
oil companies.
### Problem Statement

Satellite Image of Roorkee(247667)
 Given Sentinel-1 and PALSAR Synthetic Aperture Radar Images
of Roorkee(247667). Our Goal is to classify Railway Tracks and Urban areas among
tall Vegetated( i.e. IITR Main Building or Civil Hospital). Since SAR data set contains data in various TH-RX polarisation variations the image provided will be a .tiff image file from which data must be extracted. Finally , create a Machine Learning Model that will recognises train tracks and urban areas is built using the data collection.
